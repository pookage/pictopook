# Pic2Pook

A tool to convert the contents of a canvas to text entirely composed of the letters POOKAGE

## Current Status

Looks like the default "monospace" font on chrome isn't actually monospace - plus at the moment I'm drawing one letter for every pixel, which is far too detailed; we need to have more of a gist - so to figure out what kinda 'square' of pixels to check.  

Better downsampling needed and general code clean-up, but the gist is there. Just need to expand on the concept.
